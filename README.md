# GIMP-plugins
some photography related GIMP plugins esp. to integrate external applications like the NIK Suite, Neat Image, On1 Effects and others running in Windows 64bit

All those PY scripts are originally made by Rob Antonishen, later modifies by Partha Bagchi and again modified by Martin Pohl to have those special Addon applications integrated to GIMP
