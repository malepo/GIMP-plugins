# GIMP-plugins
some photography related GIMP plugins esp. to integrate external applications like the NIK Suite, Neat Image, On1 Effects and others running in Windows 64bit.

Most of the scripts are delivered with the GIMP for Windows versions done by Partha Bagchi (http://www.partha.com/):
all NIK*; all Topaz* and the ON1EffectsFree10.py

You will need to have such Tools installed at default location in a Windows 64bit environment.

NIK Suite (free of charge): https://www.google.com/intl/de/nikcollection/
Topaz collection (30 day trial): https://www.topazlabs.com/
On1 Effects Free: https://www.on1.com/apps/effects10free/
Neat Image (trial): https://ni.neatvideo.com/
Frazis Photo Software (trials): https://www.projects-software.com/

All those PY scripts are originally made by Rob Antonishen, later modified by Partha Bagchi and again modified by me to have those special Addon applications integrated to GIMP
